The hosting model: IMS runs on IBM z/OS mainframe operating system and is typically used in a client/server model, where clients 
access IMS applications running on the mainframe through middleware such as IBM MQ (Message Queuing).

commonly used on the mainframe. Java and Python can access IMS data via IBM IMS Enterprise Suite, which provides a set of tools for 
building, testing, and deploying IMS applications.

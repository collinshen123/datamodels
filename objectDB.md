Open-source or commercial: ObjectDB is a commercial software, but also offers a free, open-source version with some limitations.

The data model: ObjectDB is an object-oriented database that stores data in objects rather than tables. 
It supports Java Persistence API (JPA) and Java Data Objects (JDO) standards, allowing developers to use familiar 
object-oriented paradigms to manage data.

The hosting model: ObjectDB can be used in various hosting models, including client/server, embedded, and in-memory.

How Java or Python access it: ObjectDB is designed for use with Java and provides a native Java API for accessing the database. 
Python can access ObjectDB via Jython, which is an implementation of Python in Java. However, using Jython requires writing 
Java code to access the ObjectDB API.
